## <p align="center">Introduction
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny‚Äôs Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## <p align="center">Questions

#### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

  where rn=1
  union all
  select cte.rn,cte.customer_id,cte.order_date,cte.join_date,cte.points,datediff(day,cte.join_date,cte.order_date) diff,
    case when datediff(day,cte.join_date,cte.order_date)<=7 and datediff(day,cte.join_date,cte.order_date)>=0 
      then total_points*2 else total_points+cte.points end total_points 
  from cte2
  inner join cte on cte2.customer_id=cte.customer_id and cte2.rn+1=cte.rn
),last_points_cte as (

```

### <p align='center'>Bonus Questions
#### 1. Join All The Things
The following questions are related creating basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL.

| customer_id | order_date | product_name | price | member |
|-------------|------------|--------------|-------|--------|
| A           | 2021-01-01 | curry        | 15    | N      |
| A           | 2021-01-01 | sushi        | 10    | N      |
| A           | 2021-01-07 | curry        | 15    | Y      |
| A           | 2021-01-10 | ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| A           | 2021-01-11 | ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| A           | 2021-01-11 | ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| B           | 2021-01-01 | curry        | 15    | N      |
| B           | 2021-01-02 | curry        | 15    | N      |
| B           | 2021-01-04 | sushi        | 10    | N      |
| B           | 2021-01-11 | sushi        | 10    | Y      |
| B           | 2021-01-16 | ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| B           | 2021-02-01 | ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| C           | 2021-01-01 | ramen        | 12    | N      |
| C           | 2021-01-01 | ramen        | 12    | N      |
| C           | 2021-01-07 | ramen        | 12    | N      |

```sql
select s.customer_id,s.order_date,me.product_name,me.price,
  case when s.customer_id in (select customer_id from members) and m.join_date<=s.order_date then 'Y' else 'N' end members from sales s
left join members m on s.customer_id = m.customer_id
inner join menu me on s.product_id = me.product_id
```
#### 2. Rank All The Things
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
```sql
with cte as (
  select s.customer_id,s.order_date,me.product_name,me.price,
    case when s.customer_id in (select customer_id from members) and m.join_date<=s.order_date then 'Y' else 'N' end members from sales s
  left join members m on s.customer_id = m.customer_id
  inner join menu me on s.product_id = me.product_id
),ranking_cte as (
  select *,rank() over(partition by customer_id order by order_date) rnk from cte
  where members='Y'
  union all
  select *,null rnk from cte
  where members='N'
)
select * from ranking_cte
order by customer_id,order_date
```
