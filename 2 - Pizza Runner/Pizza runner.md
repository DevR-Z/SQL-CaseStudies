## <p align="center"><img src="" alt="Image" width="400" height="420">

## <p align="center">Notes
- ##### Case study's data and questions were extracted from this link: [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/). 
- ##### All questions were solved using MSSQL Server

## <p align="center">Introduction
Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway‚Ä¶)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## <p align="center">Questions
This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

- Pizza Metrics
- Runner and Customer Experience
- Ingredient Optimisation
- Pricing and Ratings
- Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)

Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement.
Again, there are many questions in this case study - please feel free to pick and choose which ones you‚Äôd like to try!
Before you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want to do something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables!

### <p align="center">A. Pizza Metrics
#### 1.How many pizzas were ordered?
```sql
select count(pizza_id) total_pizzas_ordered from customer_orders;
```

  where r.cancellation is null
)
select runner_id,round(avg(time_preparation_order*1.0),2) avg_arrive from cte
group by runner_id

```
#### 5.Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
  For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"*/
```sql
alter table pizza_recipes alter column toppings varchar(25);

order by 1,2,3,4
```
#### 6.What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?
```sql
with customer_orders_rn as (
  select row_number() over(order by order_id) rn,* from customer_orders
),exclusion_extra_toppings as (
  select rn,order_id,customer_id,pizza_id,exclusions,extras,

inner join runner_orders r on cte.order_id=r.order_id
where r.cancellation is null
group by cte.all_ingredients
order by 2 desc,1
```

### <p align="center">D. Pricing and Ratings
#### 1.If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
```sql
select sum(case when pizza_id=1 then 12 else 10 end) revenue from customer_orders c 
inner join runner_orders r on c.order_id = r.order_id
where r.cancellation is null
```
#### 2.What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
  - Add cheese is $1 extra*/
```sql
with price_with_extra as (
  select c.order_id,pizza_id,case when pizza_id=1 then 12 else 10 end price,extras,coalesce(len(extras)-len(replace(extras,',',''))+1,0) nro_extras from customer_orders c 
  inner join runner_orders r on c.order_id = r.order_id
  where r.cancellation is null 
)
select sum(price+nro_extras) revenue from price_with_extra
```
#### 3.The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
```sql
drop table if exists runner_rating;
create table runner_ratings (
  order_id integer,
  runner_id integer,
  rating int
)

insert into runner_ratings values
  (1,1,2),
  (2,1,2),
  (3,1,2),
  (4,2,1),
  (5,3,2),
  (6,3,null),
  (7,2,3),
  (8,2,5),
  (9,2,null),
  (10,1,3);

select * from runner_ratings
```
#### 4.Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
  - customer_id
  - order_id
  - runner_id
  - rating
  - order_time
  - pickup_time
  - Time between order and pickup
  - Delivery duration
  - Average speed
  - Total number of pizzas*/
```sql
with cte as (
  select runner_id,case when charindex('k',distance)!=0 then charindex('k',distance) else len(distance)+1 end flag_index,
    distance,duration,order_id
  from runner_orders
  where cancellation is null
),cte2 as (
  select runner_id,order_id,cast(left(distance,flag_index-1) as decimal(3,1)) distance,cast(left(duration,2) as int)*60 duration_secs from cte
),speed_cte as (
  select runner_id,order_id,distance*1000/duration_secs speed_ms from cte2
),request_cte as (

  from customer_orders c
  inner join runner_orders ro on c.order_id = ro.order_id
  inner join runner_ratings rr on ro.order_id=rr.order_id and ro.runner_id=rr.runner_id
  where ro.cancellation is null
)
select cte1.customer_id,cte1.order_id,cte1.runner_id,cte1.rating,cte1.order_time,cte1.pickup_time,cte1.duration_mins,

group by cte1.customer_id,cte1.order_id,cte1.runner_id,cte1.rating,cte1.order_time,cte1.pickup_time,cte1.duration_mins
order by 2
```
#### 5.If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
```sql
with cte as (
  select runner_id,order_id,
    distance,case when charindex('k',distance)!=0 then charindex('k',distance) else len(distance)+1 end flag_index
  from runner_orders 
  where cancellation is null
),runner_delivery_cost_cte as (
  select order_id,runner_id,cast(left(distance,flag_index-1) as decimal(3,1))*0.3 as runner_delivery_cost from cte
),request_cte as (
  select c.order_id,sum(case when c.pizza_id=1 then 12 else 10 end) price,rc.runner_delivery_cost from customer_orders c
  inner join runner_orders r on c.order_id = r.order_id
  inner join runner_delivery_cost_cte rc on r.order_id=rc.order_id and r.runner_id=rc.runner_id
  where r.cancellation is null
  group by c.order_id,rc.runner_delivery_cost
)
select sum(price-runner_delivery_cost) revenue from request_cte
```
### <p align="center">E. Bonus Questions
#### 1.If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?
```sql
alter table pizza_recipes alter column toppings varchar(50);
insert into pizza_recipes(pizza_id,toppings) select 3 pizza_id,string_agg(topping_id,', ') from pizza_toppings
insert into pizza_names values(3,'Supreme Pizza');
```
